\section{Abstract}

Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) are a family of network models that are useful in modelling complex network structures, such as corporate connections and social relations. ERGMs benefit from many of the properties that make their namesake, the exponential family, such a powerful device in statistical literature. 

Equilibrium Expectation, a recent development in the inference of Exponential Random Graph Models proposes an efficient means to compute the parameters of large networks, a typically challenging computational problem. Through leveraging the Markov Chain properties at equilibrium it is able to make infrequent, albeit complex, updates to the parameter values to reduce computation effort required.

In contrast, Stochastic Approximation by Robbins and Monro as well as Monte Carlo methods popularised by \textbf{x, y, etc}, have been staples in the estimation of ERGM parameters for a number of years. As such, this paper will seek to benchmark the Equilibrium Expectation algorithm against Stochastic Approximation and MCMC under \textbf{comparison methods}.
