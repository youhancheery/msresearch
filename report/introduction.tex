\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item Mention something about ERGMs and how they're used
\item This includes the math side - and about network statistics
\item Talk a little about the intractable denominator when it comes to ERGM estimation
\item Computational challenges in ERGMs
\end{itemize}

Exponential Random Graph models take the form:

\begin{equation}
\pi(x, \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \frac{1}{k(\boldsymbol{\theta})}\exp{\left(\sum_A{\theta_Az_A(x)}\right)}
\end{equation}
