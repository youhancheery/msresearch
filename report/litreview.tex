\section{Literature Review}  

In order to benchmark the Equilibrium Expectation estimation method we start by considering the two classes from which currently popular estimation techniques lie: stochastic approximation and Monte Carlo Maximum Likelihood Estimation.

\subsection{Stochastic Approximation}

Stochastic Approximation methods were among the first approaches to estimating the ERGM parameters by finding the actual MLE. We specifically note that the these techniques sought the "actual" MLE as it is worth discussing the Maximum Pseudo Likelihood Estimation of ERGM parameters \citet{straussikeda1990}.

Due to the normalising constant, generating the parameters of the ERGM is usually intractable. \citeauthor{straussikeda1990} proposed an approach where calcualating the maximum likelihood function wasn't done on the direct likelihood, rather on a 'pseudo' likelihood.
